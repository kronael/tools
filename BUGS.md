### dockbox: guest-editable skills without exposing credentials (TODO)

dockbox bind-mounts the whole `~/.claude` / `~/.codex` **rw** into the container
(`dockbox:12,18`). The intent is that the guest can edit **skills**
(`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents`) — but it does NOT need read/write to the
**sensitive config** (the API tokens in `~/.claude`/`~/.codex`). Scope: keep the
skill dirs editable while keeping credentials out of the guest's reach (mount
them ro / redacted / not at all) — not a full config copy-in (that isn't
needed). Lower priority — dockbox's README already discloses it is not a
boundary for hostile code.

### Deferred — need sign-off

- **qemubox / dockbox shared-UX de-dup.** The two tools duplicate flag parsing,
  the tool/model table, `ls`/`rm`/`prune`, and the lifecycle block. A shared
  sourced file would violate the repo's "tools are independent, no imports"
  rule (`CLAUDE.md`); `tests/drift_test.sh` is the accepted lightweight guard
  instead. Revisit only with sign-off.

Resolved items are pruned to `.diary/` (20260818–20260821) and `CHANGELOG.md`
(v0.3.72–v0.3.75): the 2026-08-18 qemubox security audit, the mount-confinement
redesign (curated staging + config copy-in + per-slug session data), the
9p/genericcloud boot fixes, the ref-counted-lifecycle audit, the CEO/CTO
follow-ups, the robustness backlog (`a2d0537..43467d0`, `91f91a8`), and the
install housekeeping (`ce7c39a`). This pass: `rm` now requires an explicit
pattern (`'*'` = all) and qemubox persists its SSH port in `$dir/port`
(`d80c486`); dockbox toolchain bumped (`c04c956`).
