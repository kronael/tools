# Critical Rules (re-injected on compaction)

- ALWAYS use make for build/lint/test/clean
- ALWAYS build/test/lint every ~50 lines
- NEVER improve beyond what's asked
- NEVER use /tmp, ALWAYS use ./tmp in project root
- NEVER use git add -A
- NEVER use git commit --amend
- NEVER add Co-Authored-By to commits
